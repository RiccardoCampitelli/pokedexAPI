Hey! This is my pokemon information API

## Prerequisites:

To be able to run this you will need to have the following installed:

- Nodejs -> https://nodejs.org/en/
- Docker -> https://www.docker.com/get-started

## How to run:

 - npm install
 - npm run start

## How to spin up docker container:

## Things I would improve:

- Add DI
- Move clients into different package and install them as dependencies
- Enable urls to be config driven
